Professional Summary
I am a dynamic and adaptable professional with a proven ability to thrive in challenging environments, bringing a strong blend of teamwork and independent problem-solving to every task. My experience as an intern at Everyday Angels in Portsmouth, VA, honed my organizational and crisis management skills, where I efficiently managed workloads, de-escalated conflicts, and supported client well-being through attentive care and social engagement. With a commitment to excellence, I consistently go beyond expectations, leveraging my quick learning ability and strong communication skills to deliver high-quality results in fast-paced settings.
My technical aptitude and eagerness to grow are evident in my academic journey as a sophomore pursuing a degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering at Elizabeth City State University, where I maintain a 3.12 GPA. I have developed foundational skills in Python, Terminal/Bash, and GitHub, complementing my practical experience in inventory management and customer service from over two years at Jersey Mike’s in Suffolk, VA. At Jersey Mike’s, I demonstrated efficiency, teamwork, and a customer-focused approach, ensuring a clean, safe, and well-stocked environment while fostering positive relationships with colleagues and customers.
Beyond my professional and academic pursuits, I bring leadership and discipline from my role as a two-year starter on the Elizabeth City State University football team. My ability to prioritize tasks, think creatively and analytically, and resolve conflicts makes me a versatile contributor to any team. With a solid foundation from my high school education (3.0 GPA, King’s Fork High School, 2024) and a passion for continuous learning, I am excited to apply my skills and dedication to new opportunities in engineering and beyond.
